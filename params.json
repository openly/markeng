{"name":"Markeng","tagline":"Markup engineering.","body":"### Welcome to Markeng.\r\nMarkeng is a tool to engineer the front-end. It allows to develop HTML pages in a more structured way.\r\n\r\n### Why did I develop it?\r\nBeing a developer of front-end myself, I was always frustrated by lack of structure. By the time a project is ready to deliver, we would have got a few big HTML, CSS and JS files. Maintenance was a nightmare, because we could never figure out where the Markup, and other assets were for a particular section.\r\nWe at [Openly|http://openly.co] put a massive effort to improve the standards using LESS, building modular JavaScript, Using build tools such as RequireJS and Grunt etc. They defnitely improved the front-end quality, but we were not convinced still that it was sufficient.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n```\r\nnpm install -g markeng\r\n```\r\n### Usage\r\nMarkeng splits up contents in pages and components. \r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
